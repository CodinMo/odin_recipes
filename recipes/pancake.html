    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French pancake or "crepes" are a versatile and delicate French dish, made from a simple batter of flour, eggs, milk, and a pinch of salt. This thin batter is poured onto a hot, lightly greased skillet and spread evenly to create a thin, lacy pancake. Once the edges begin to lift and the underside turns golden brown, the crepe is flipped to cook the other side. The result is a light, slightly crisp crepe that serves as a perfect canvas for both sweet and savory fillings.</p>
    <p>Crepes can be enjoyed in a variety of ways, reflecting their adaptability. Sweet crepes are often filled with ingredients like fresh fruit, Nutella, whipped cream, or a sprinkle of sugar and lemon juice. Savory crepes might include fillings such as ham and cheese, sautéed vegetables, or eggs. Whether served as a breakfast treat, a dessert, or a main course, crepes are beloved for their simplicity and endless customization options, making them a staple in many culinary traditions worldwide.</p>
