    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Swiss fondue is a traditional dish hailing from Switzerland, featuring a pot of melted cheese served with bread for dipping. Typically, a blend of Swiss cheeses such as Gruyère and Emmental is used, combined with white wine and a hint of garlic. The mixture is heated in a special pot called a caquelon, which is placed over a small burner to keep the cheese warm and smooth. The dish is enjoyed by dipping bite-sized pieces of crusty bread into the molten cheese using long-stemmed forks.</p>
    <p>Fondue is more than just a meal; it's a communal dining experience that brings people together. The act of sharing a pot of cheese encourages conversation and camaraderie. Traditionally served in the colder months, it provides warmth and comfort. Beyond bread, other dippers like boiled potatoes, vegetables, and even fruit can be used, making it a versatile and beloved dish in Swiss culture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups shredded Gruyère cheese</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups shredded Emmental cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, halved</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups dry white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine Gruyère cheese, Emmental cheese, and cornstarch in a bowl. Mix until the cheese is evenly coated. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Rub the cut side of the garlic all over the inside of a fondue pot or heavy saucepan. Add wine and place over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then gradually add cheese and cornstarch mixture. Stir with a spatula, gently stirring in a figure-of-eight motion, until all of the cheese is added and the fondue is smooth and homogenous. Reduce heat to medium-low if the fondue is boiling too vigorously.</li>
        <li>Immediately serve fondue, preferably over a warmer. If you used a saucepan on the stove to heat the fondue, you can carefully transfer the fondue to a fondue pot to serve.</li>
